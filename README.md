### Questions

1. In the <b>accounts</b> table, there is a column holding the <b>website</b> for each company. The last three digits specify what type of web address they are using. A list of extensions (and pricing) is provided [here](https://iwantmyname.com/domains). Pull these extensions and provide how many of each website type exist in the <b>accounts</b> table.

2. There is much debate about how much the name (or even the first letter of a company name) matters. Use the <b>accounts</b> table to pull the first letter of each company name to see the distribution of company names that begin with each letter (or number).

3. Use the <b>accounts</b> table and a <b>CASE</b> statement to create two groups: one group of company names that start with a number and a second group of those company names that start with a letter. What proportion of company names start with a letter?

4. Consider vowels as ```a```, ```e```, ```i```, ```o```, and ```u```. What proportion of company names start with a vowel, and what percent start with anything else?
